# Crawling Agony

An open-world game inspired by Project Zomboid

Project Zomboid is a nice game but has very bad performance and hard mechanics, we plan to make an open-source alternative.

## Goals

- Implement an isometric camera
- Implement player models
- Implement an official map
- Add many weapons
- Support community maps
- Support modding
- Add natural disasters
